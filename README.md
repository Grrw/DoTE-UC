# DoTE-UC
A file to copy Users into Users-Copy
## To-Do:
- [ ] Create a Unix (non-macOS) Version (will be tested on Ubuntu, due to it's widespread use)
- [X] Test and Finalze the Windows Version
- [ ] [2/3] Create a file to replace Users with Users-Copy (or make it an option on each file)

## Purpose:
In Dungeon of the Endless, the game will often crash when loading the next level. As a result of the game deleting the save files once they are loaded, if the game crashes you cannot continue where you left off.

By copying the Users folder into Users-Copy, if the game crashes you can replace Users with your copy and continue your game.

You can also use this to cheat, but I don't care.

## Important:
* In the Windows folder, UCWindows deltes old Users-Copy and replaces it with a copy of Users
* In the Windows folder, UC2UWindows deletes Users and replaces it with a copy of Users-Copy
* In the macOS folder, UCmacOS returns a prompt asking if you want to copy Users, or replace Users
